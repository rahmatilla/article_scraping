Bonus Part. Some questions for reasoning:

- How would you automate this process so that we can get new datasets every day?
- What file format would you use to store this data?
- How would you evaluate the quality of the collected data?

Answers:
- I automate this process using crontab in Linux(Ubuntu) OS, Windows Task Scheduler in Windows OS.
- CSV file.
- Firstly I use Jupiter Notebook during coding to view results in each process step by step. After saving, I open dataset with excel to check "word" column by filtering and sorting.
